## A3: Information Architecture

The Information Architecture artefact provides a high-level overview of the system's information architecture. 
The main objectives are listed below:
- Contribute to the identification and description of user needs, as well as the generation of new ones;
- Examine and test the UI of the product;
- Allow for several iterations of the user interface design in a short amount of time.

There are two components to this artefact:
- A sitemap;
- A pair of wireframes.



### 1. Sitemap

> Sitemap presenting the overall structure of the web application.  
> Each page must be identified in the sitemap.  
> Multiple instances of the same page (e.g. student profile in SIGARRA) are presented as page stacks.


### 2. Wireframes

A website wireframe is a visual representation of a website’s skeleton architecture. Below there are two wireframes, one is a representation of what the item page resembles, while the other one reveals how the user profile looks like.

#### UIxx: Page Name
